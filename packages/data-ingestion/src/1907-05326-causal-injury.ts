/**
 * The acute:chronic workload ratio: challenges and prospects for improvement
 *
 * arXiv:1907.05326 · lane:causal_injury · verdict:ADAPT · owner:Motif-lab
 *
 * ADDITIVE utility. Not wired into any live ingestion path (wiring changes production data flow
 * and is a NEEDS HUMAN CALL).
 *
 * Paper mechanism: Causal-inference primitives for injury studies: inverse-propensity weights for confounding
 * adjustment (propensities strictly inside (0,1)), difference-in-differences for pre/post
 * treatment-vs-control designs, and standardized mean differences (Cohen's d) for covariate balance
 * checks.
 *
 * Improvement (wiring record): Build gse-workload-risk with UNCOUPLED ratios only (7-day acute load vs prior 28-day chronic
 * excluding the acute window), injury probability as a smooth GAM/spline of the continuous ratio, and
 * time-matched nested case-control labels; never ship the IOC 0.8-1.3/1.5 bins.
 *
 * ACCEPTANCE GATE: ADOPT the workload-risk feature into GSE's injury overlay only if: (a) leave-one-season-out AUC >=
 * 0.60 for next-week injury among skill-position players; (b) the low-ACWR risk artifact is absent
 * (monotone or flat risk below ratio 1.0); (c) the risk curve's inflection point is identified from
 * the continuous fit with bootstrap 90% CI width < 0.5 ratio units.
 *
 * Ingest role: causal estimation helpers (IPW, difference-in-differences, balance diagnostics).
 * Live data: NO. Runs offline on stored snapshots / synthetic fixtures.
 * Pure module: no I/O, no network, no credentials. Fail-closed: malformed input returns null/[].
