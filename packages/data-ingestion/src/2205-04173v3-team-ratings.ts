/**
 * Nested Zero Inflated Generalized Poisson Regression for FIFA World Cup 2022
 *
 * arXiv:2205.04173v3 · lane:team_ratings · verdict:ADAPT · owner:Mimo
 *
 * ADDITIVE utility. Not wired into any live ingestion path (wiring changes production data flow
 * and is a NEEDS HUMAN CALL).
 *
 * Paper mechanism: Elo ratings on the 400-point scale with logistic win probabilities, zero-sum updates scaled by K, a
 * 538-style margin-of-victory multiplier that damps blowouts by the pre-game Elo gap, and weighted
 * blending across rating systems.
 *
 * Improvement (wiring record): Build the nested + in-simulation-update playoff engine: per-game team points ~ Normal/NB with mean
 * from nested regression — mu_A(offense A vs defense B, averaged both-ways), then mu_B|A conditional
 * on realized points_A (garbage-time/defense-relaxation); covariates = GSE ratings instead of Elo
 * points, home/neutral, rest differential; game weights w(m) = (1/2)^{days/H} x importance (playoffs
 * 2-4x) with team-specific regime-aware decay (half-life shortens after coaching/QB changes, learned
 * by backtest log-likelihood).
 *
 * ACCEPTANCE GATE: ADOPT iff across postseasons 2020-2024: mean Brier beats GSE's current static-strength sim by >=5%
 * AND beats/ties the futures-implied baseline on RPS in >=4 of 5 postseasons; REJECT if the
 * in-simulation update adds nothing over the static sim.
 *
 * Ingest role: team rating inputs (Elo updates, MOV multiplier, rating blends).
 * Live data: NO. Runs offline on stored snapshots / synthetic fixtures.
 * Pure module: no I/O, no network, no credentials. Fail-closed: malformed input returns null/[].
