/**
 * 1719 TwitterPaul: extracting and aggregating Twitter predictions
 *
 * arXiv:1211.6496 · lane:nlp · verdict:ADAPT · owner:Motif-lab
 *
 * ADDITIVE utility. Not wired into any live ingestion path (wiring changes production data flow
 * and is a NEEDS HUMAN CALL).
 *
 * Paper mechanism: Lightweight text signal extraction for reports and commentary: lowercase alphanumeric tokenization,
 * lexicon-weighted sentiment scoring normalized by token count, and Jaccard keyword overlap for
 * near-duplicate and similarity checks.
 *
 * Improvement (wiring record): Build gse/signals/social_predictions.py: extract (game, predicted side, strength
 * strong/weak/support, negation-aware) from NFL X/Twitter posts with a fine-tuned classifier, maintain
 * per-account trust scores from historical prediction accuracy on resolved games, aggregate per game
 * with trust x strength weighting into a crowd-consensus probability, and feed it into the
 * market-microstructure model as a public-lean proxy and contrarian divergence signal.
 *
 * ACCEPTANCE GATE: ADAPT proceeds if the reproducible test shows extraction F1 >= 0.80 with negation handling and the
 * consensus feature improves a line-plus-consensus model; REJECT the social-consensus signal for any
 * game/week where extraction volume falls below a coverage threshold.
 *
 * Ingest role: text feature extraction (tokenization, lexicon scoring, keyword overlap).
 * Live data: NO. Runs offline on stored snapshots / synthetic fixtures.
 * Pure module: no I/O, no network, no credentials. Fail-closed: malformed input returns null/[].
