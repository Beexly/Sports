/**
 * Multi-modal Attention Network for Stock Movements Prediction

 * arXiv:2112.13593v5 · lane:nlp · verdict:ADAPT · owner:Motif-lab
 *
 * ADDITIVE utility. Not wired into any live ingestion path (wiring changes production data flow
 * and is a NEEDS HUMAN CALL).
 *
 * Paper mechanism: Lightweight text signal extraction for reports and commentary: lowercase alphanumeric tokenization,
 * lexicon-weighted sentiment scoring normalized by token count, and Jaccard keyword overlap for
 * near-duplicate and similarity checks.
 *
 * Improvement (wiring record): Build a credibility-weighted analyst-text fusion for closing-line direction: per NFL game, encode X
 * posts from inventoried analyst accounts with a sentence transformer, compute per-poster credibility
 * from GSE's verification data (historical pick accuracy, CLV of past calls), fuse text embeddings
 * with numeric line-movement features (open->current deltas, steam flags) via credibility-gated
 * cross-attention, with time-to-kickoff positional encoding.
 *
 * ACCEPTANCE GATE: Full-model 61.20% accuracy / MCC 0.1193 vs CapTE 59.87% / 0.0976, credibility ablation +1.14pp
 * (60.06% -> 61.20%): ADOPT only if the credibility-weighting ablation reproduces on walk-forward NFL
 * data; do not adopt if it doesn't.
 *
 * Ingest role: text feature extraction (tokenization, lexicon scoring, keyword overlap).
 * Live data: NO. Runs offline on stored snapshots / synthetic fixtures.
 * Pure module: no I/O, no network, no credentials. Fail-closed: malformed input returns null/[].
