/**
 * MatchTime: Towards Automatic Soccer Game Commentary Generation
 *
 * arXiv:2406.18530 · lane:nlp · verdict:ADAPT · owner:Hermes
 *
 * ADDITIVE utility. Not wired into any live ingestion path (wiring changes production data flow
 * and is a NEEDS HUMAN CALL).
 *
 * Paper mechanism: Lightweight text signal extraction for reports and commentary: lowercase alphanumeric tokenization,
 * lexicon-weighted sentiment scoring normalized by token count, and Jaccard keyword overlap for
 * near-duplicate and similarity checks.
 *
 * Improvement (wiring record): Port the MatchTime event-to-commentary alignment methodology to NFL: swap CLIP ViT-B/32 for a
 * domain-finetuned encoder, inject player identity via roster/jersey-number vision to fix the
 * anonymity limitation, and extend alignment from commentary to play-by-play text, measuring
 * downstream impact on the GSE event-classifier F1.
 *
 * ACCEPTANCE GATE: ACCEPTED (ADAPT): public datasets + released pipeline + quantified gains on both stages + ablations
 * isolating each component.
 *
 * Ingest role: text feature extraction (tokenization, lexicon scoring, keyword overlap).
 * Live data: NO. Runs offline on stored snapshots / synthetic fixtures.
 * Pure module: no I/O, no network, no credentials. Fail-closed: malformed input returns null/[].
