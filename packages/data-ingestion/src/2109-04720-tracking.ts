/**
 * 6MapNet: Representing Soccer Players by a Triplet Network
 *
 * arXiv:2109.04720 · lane:tracking · verdict:ADAPT · owner:Motif-lab
 *
 * ADDITIVE utility. Not wired into any live ingestion path (wiring changes production data flow
 * and is a NEEDS HUMAN CALL).
 *
 * Paper mechanism: Frame-differenced player kinematics: per-step speed from Euclidean displacement over the frame
 * interval, acceleration from speed differences, and catch-point separation as the minimum defender
 * distance - the raw material for route-running, coverage, and ball-carrier features.
 *
 * Improvement (wiring record): Build 6MapNet-style triplet re-identification on NFL tracking: per player-drive, location heatmaps
 * (field grid) + direction heatmaps (velocity vectors above 4 m/s) from Big Data Bowl tracking;
 * identities = player + K-means route/coverage role-cluster; 3-drive augmentation by pixel-wise
 * addition; triplet CNN (alpha=0.1, hard-negative mining, ATL-sim outlier filtering) — then learn the
 * role assignment jointly (multi-task role classifier + triplet embedding), add ball-relative features
 * (distance/angle to ball) as a third heatmap channel, and test zero-shot transfer (retrieval
 * precision@10) to unseen players.
 *
 * ACCEPTANCE GATE: ADAPT if: on NFL tracking, 6MapNet-style embeddings beat raw-heatmap L2 re-identification by >=10
 * percentage points top-1 accuracy on held-out player-drive entities, with top-10 >= 80%. Otherwise
 * keep only the ATL-sim outlier-filtering trick and drop the triplet network.
 *
 * Ingest role: tracking kinematics (speeds, accelerations, catch-point separation).
 * Live data: NO. Runs offline on stored snapshots / synthetic fixtures.
 * Pure module: no I/O, no network, no credentials. Fail-closed: malformed input returns null/[].
