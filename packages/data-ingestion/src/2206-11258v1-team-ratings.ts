/**
 * Developing a Ranking Problem Library (RPLIB) from a data-oriented perspective
 *
 * arXiv:2206.11258v1 · lane:team_ratings · verdict:ADAPT · owner:Mimo
 *
 * ADDITIVE utility. Not wired into any live ingestion path (wiring changes production data flow
 * and is a NEEDS HUMAN CALL).
 *
 * Paper mechanism: Elo ratings on the 400-point scale with logistic win probabilities, zero-sum updates scaled by K, a
 * 538-style margin-of-victory multiplier that damps blowouts by the pre-game Elo gap, and weighted
 * blending across rating systems.
 *
 * Improvement (wiring record): Build a rankability module in the Sports repo: for any dominance matrix D-bar (pairwise team win
 * counts; unit-advantage indicators), solve the LOP exactly (n=32, scipy.milp/OR-Tools), compute k
 * (distance to nearest perfectly rankable matrix), |P| (optimal-solution count), tau (max Kendall-tau
 * over the pool), and beta (fractional-entry-weighted positional indecision); apply to weekly NFL
 * power-ranking instances (flag ambiguous top-8 weeks -> shrink edge estimates) and to GSE's
 * model-comparison matrices (is 'model A > model B' even rankable?) — then make beta stake-weighted by
 * betting handle/edge at each rank position, turning a descriptive diagnostic into a risk-management
 * input for bet sizing.
 *
 * ACCEPTANCE GATE: ADOPT beta as a diagnostic iff on 2015-2023, preseason beta explains >=10% additional variance
 * (delta R^2 >= 0.10) in next-season Massey prediction error beyond k and |P| alone, with the same
 * sign confirmed on 2024; REJECT if beta adds nothing over the three existing measures.
 *
 * Ingest role: team rating inputs (Elo updates, MOV multiplier, rating blends).
 * Live data: NO. Runs offline on stored snapshots / synthetic fixtures.
 * Pure module: no I/O, no network, no credentials. Fail-closed: malformed input returns null/[].
