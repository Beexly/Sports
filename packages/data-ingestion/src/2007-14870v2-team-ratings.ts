 *
 * ADDITIVE utility. Not wired into any live ingestion path (wiring changes production data flow
 * and is a NEEDS HUMAN CALL).
 *
 * Paper mechanism: Elo ratings on the 400-point scale with logistic win probabilities, zero-sum updates scaled by K, a
 * 538-style margin-of-victory multiplier that damps blowouts by the pre-game Elo gap, and weighted
 * blending across rating systems.
 *
 * Improvement (wiring record): Build an IRT evaluation layer over the engine's backtest history: items = historical game-weeks (or
 * individual spread/total picks), respondents = model versions (v5.2.7 and predecessors/challengers),
 * responses = pick correct/incorrect; fit 2PL/3PL per season, extract per-pick difficulty and
 * discrimination, compute per-model True-Score and run Glicko-2 round-robins across seasons to rank
 * model versions by difficulty-adjusted ability; weight future backtests toward high-discrimination
 * games; diagnose systematically hard game types (divisional, short-rest, weather).
 *
 * ACCEPTANCE GATE: ADOPT the IRT layer if (a) item difficulties show meaningful spread AND (b) at least one model
 * version changes rank vs raw accuracy, demonstrating the difficulty adjustment has signal. Reject if
 * all items are near-uniform difficulty or negative-discrimination items exceed ~10% of games.
 *
 * Ingest role: team rating inputs (Elo updates, MOV multiplier, rating blends).
 * Live data: NO. Runs offline on stored snapshots / synthetic fixtures.
 * Pure module: no I/O, no network, no credentials. Fail-closed: malformed input returns null/[].
