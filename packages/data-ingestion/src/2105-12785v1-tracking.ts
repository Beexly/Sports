/**
 * The Anatomy of Corner 3s in the NBA: What makes them efficient, how are they generated and how can defenses respond?
 *
 * arXiv:2105.12785v1 · lane:tracking · verdict:ADAPT · owner:Motif-lab
 *
 * ADDITIVE utility. Not wired into any live ingestion path (wiring changes production data flow
 * and is a NEEDS HUMAN CALL).
 *
 * Paper mechanism: Frame-differenced player kinematics: per-step speed from Euclidean displacement over the frame
 * interval, acceleration from speed differences, and catch-point separation as the minimum defender
 * distance - the raw material for route-running, coverage, and ball-carrier features.
 *
 * Improvement (wiring record): Port the trajectory-clustering pipeline to GSE's NGS lane: replicate section 3.2 on NGS 10 Hz
 * tracking — cluster pass-rush arcs (first 1.5 s post-snap) and route stems (first 2 s of routes) with
 * k-means + gap statistic + radius-of-gyration coherence to discover empirical archetypes (e.g.,
 * 'anchored edge contain' vs 'stunt inside'); port the commit-vs-help game model to NFL help decisions
 * (safety commit-to-man vs robber on run-pass conflict; edge contain vs crash) — and replace
 * fixed-window k-means with dynamic-time-warping clustering (k-medoids on DTW distance) to handle
 * variable NFL play timing, testing whether DTW archetypes predict pressure/sack outcomes better
 * (out-of-sample AUC for pressure within 2.5 s) than Euclidean clusters.
 *
 * ACCEPTANCE GATE: Adopt the trajectory-clustering pipeline into GSE's NGS lane if the reproducible test yields >=2
 * clusters each containing >=20% of pass-rush snaps with radius of gyration below the median of all
 * clusters AND the cluster archetypes are interpretable as distinct rush styles on manual review of
 * >=50 sampled snaps.
 *
 * Ingest role: tracking kinematics (speeds, accelerations, catch-point separation).
 * Live data: NO. Runs offline on stored snapshots / synthetic fixtures.
 * Pure module: no I/O, no network, no credentials. Fail-closed: malformed input returns null/[].
