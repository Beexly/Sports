/**
 * Prediction and Evaluation in College Hockey using the Bradley-Terry-Zermelo Model
 *
 * arXiv:2001.04226v2 · lane:team_ratings · verdict:ADAPT · owner:Hermes
 *
 * ADDITIVE utility. Not wired into any live ingestion path (wiring changes production data flow
 * and is a NEEDS HUMAN CALL).
 *
 * Paper mechanism: Elo ratings on the 400-point scale with logistic win probabilities, zero-sum updates scaled by K, a
 * 538-style margin-of-victory multiplier that damps blowouts by the pre-game Elo gap, and weighted
 * blending across rating systems.
 *
 * Improvement (wiring record): Ship uncertainty-quantified team ratings: fit Bradley-Terry with a generalized-logistic/Gaussian
 * prior plus a lambda_H home parameter, build the Hessian, invert for the covariance, and serve
 * posterior-predictive win probabilities (MC over the Gaussian, N=20,000) instead of point estimates,
 * with a Bayes-factor model-evaluation protocol using playoff games as the evaluation set.
 *
 * ACCEPTANCE GATE: ADOPT (A) and (B) into the ratings/verification stack if the section-12 test passes:
 * posterior-predictive beats point-estimate BT by >=0.02 nats/game on 2015-2025 NFL postseasons.
 *
 * Ingest role: team rating inputs (Elo updates, MOV multiplier, rating blends).
 * Live data: NO. Runs offline on stored snapshots / synthetic fixtures.
 * Pure module: no I/O, no network, no credentials. Fail-closed: malformed input returns null/[].
