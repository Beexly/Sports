/**
 * Data Refresh Worker — v5
 *
 * Fetches live odds every 30 minutes, enriches with game context
 * (opening lines, rest days, schedule density, ATS form), then scores picks.
 *
 * Pick generation is delegated to processSport() from @sports/ingestion-pipeline,
 * which is the single source of truth shared with the admin trigger-refresh route.
 *
 * Bootstrap safety: reads PlatformConfig on every cycle. Behavior gates:
 *   - DERIVED_MODEL_HISTORY_ENABLED: controls whether ATS/H2H/venue form
 *     influence scoring. When false, only canonical market signals are used.
 *   - CANONICAL_HISTORY_ENABLED: controls isBootstrap flag on new picks and
 *     TeamGameLog entries. When false, all writes are marked bootstrap.
 *   - FEATURED_PICK_PROMOTION_ENABLED: when false, isFeatured=false for all picks.
 *   - OUTCOME_LEARNING_ENABLED: when true, settled canonical snapshots become
 *     eligibleForLearning=true, enabling future outcome-anchored calibration.
 *
 * Intelligence architecture (v5):
 *   Layer 1 — External truth: sportsbook odds, lines, market depth
 *   Layer 2 — Derived signals: schedule density, line movement, rest/B2B
 *   Layer 3 — Guarded history: canonical ATS/H2H form (gated by flags)
 *   Learning: PickSignalSnapshot captures prediction-time signal state;
 *             future calibration reads snapshots joined to settled outcomes.
