Dated entries only. Each entry carries what changed, what was proven, what was not, and what the
next role must do. See `ORG.md` for the contract.

## 2026-10-28 — Verifier

**Changed:** nothing (verification role). Read `engine-reasoning-audit-2026-10-28.md`.

**Proven:** the coach lock is odds-free by type (`CoachLockPacket` has no odds field) and
`readCoachLock` is the first statement of `scoreSpreadPick`. The simulation runs through
`coach-projection → coach-sim → locked-projection → simulateCoachGame`. All six factor builders are
invoked once each. Measured: `coachSupport` −5.0 → shift −0.75 against a stub of 3 →
`coachOverridesStub: false`.

**Not proven:** that the projection is accurate for any team — it is not, because `pointLocation`
takes only `coachSupport` and `injuryDropOff`.

**Next role (Builder):** feed `pointLocation` from 2026 pbp team EPA and pace so margin and total
start from the matchup instead of the constants 3 and 46.5.

## 2026-10-28 — Librarian

**Changed:** `docs/strategy/ORG.md`, `docs/strategy/engine-reasoning-audit-2026-10-28.md`,
`scripts/guardrails/definition-of-done.mjs`, this file.

**Proven:** the DoD gate runs and reports four conditions; `--check` mode never fails.

**Not proven:** that the roles are adopted. That is a habit, not a file.

**Next role (any):** take one role, not two. Hand off with all four fields.
