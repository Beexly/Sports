# AGENTS.md — autonomous run contract

Auto-loaded by coding agents at workspace root. Read this first, every session.

Repository rules live in `CLAUDE.md` and apply in full. This file governs how an
**unattended agent** works here.

---

## THE LOOP

```
1. Open handoff/LEDGER.md
2. First task marked TODO -> mark CLAIMED with the time
3. Do exactly that task, nothing else
4. Run its Definition of Done
5. Mark DONE or BLOCKED with ONE line of evidence
6. If it produced code, commit it
7. Go to 1
```

Never ask what to do next — the ledger knows. If every row is DONE or BLOCKED, open
`docs/ops/hermes/CONTINUOUS.md` and take the next phase, or its STANDING ORDERS, which
never run out. The owner is asleep. The ledger is how you talk to them.

---

## THE LAWS

Breaking one discards the run.

1. **NEVER `git push`.** Commit locally. The owner reviews and pushes.
2. **NEVER modify:** `packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma` · `packages/db/prisma/migrations/**` ·
   `.github/workflows/**` · `scripts/guardrails/**` · `.claude/**` · any `.env*` ·
   `package-lock.json` · `.gitignore` · `.githooks/**` · `apps/web/lib/ai-control-plane/**`
3. **NEVER flip a gate or env flag** — `PUBLIC_PICKS`, `STATS_PUBLIC`, `LIVE_BOARD`,
   `PERFORMANCE_STATS`, any other. Never edit code so a gate resolves differently.
   Never run a cron with a real secret. Never search for credentials. These gates are
   the honesty boundary; opening one publishes an unearned claim.
4. **NEVER write a claim you did not observe.** Every report line traces to a command
   you ran and output you saw. Not run → write `NOT RUN`. Failed → paste the error.
   An honest gap is a contribution; an invented fact is sabotage.
5. **NEVER mark DONE** unless the Definition of Done commands actually passed.
6. **NEVER `git commit --no-verify`.**
7. **NEVER install a package, run a migration, or touch a database.** (Bare
   `npm install` is fine — it is setup.)
8. **NEVER fabricate product data** — no mock picks, sample odds, placeholder win
   rates, invented benchmarks. Anywhere.
9. **NEVER weaken a guard to make a test pass.** Never delete a phrase from a
   forbidden-copy list, never loosen an assertion's intent, never change a guardrail's
   threshold. If a guard is red, either the code is wrong or the guard needs *narrower*
   context — never less power.

## WORKING RULES

- **Two attempts per task.** Then revert, mark `BLOCKED` with the exact error text,
  move on. Never a third. A BLOCKED task with an honest error is a success.
- **One task = one commit.** Stage by name — never `git add -A` or `git add .`.
  Tag every message `[hermes-<task-id>]`.
- **Verify block before every code commit:**
  ```bash
  npm run typecheck 2>&1 | grep -c "error TS"   # must print 0
  npm run lint                                   # exit 0
  npx vitest run <this task's test file>         # green
  ```
- TypeScript is strict. Never `any`, `as any`, `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-expect-error`.
- Update the ledger the moment a status changes. Never batch it.

---

## DECISION BUDGET

Per task: **3 file reads · 2 command runs · ONE conclusion · then act.**

If you catch yourself writing *"actually"*, *"wait"*, *"let me reconsider"*, or
*"let me think about this differently"* — **stop. You already have your answer.**
Execute it. If it is wrong, the Definition of Done catches it and you get one retry.
That is what two strikes are for. Never re-derive a conclusion you already reached.

**PRECEDENT FIRST** on any test repair — before analysing anything:
```bash
git grep -l "<the symbol or module the test needs>" -- "*.test.ts"
```
If another test already mocks it, copy that pattern. That is both the answer and the
evidence, in one step.

---

## CONTEXT HYGIENE — this is what keeps you alive

You will be cut off when your context fills. That is expected and survivable, because
the ledger holds your state. Make each session last longer:

- Do not re-read a file you already read this session.
- Do not re-read `CONTINUOUS.md` in full — jump to the section you need.
- Do not summarise your progress unless you are about to be cut off.
- Do not restate a root cause already written in the ledger.
- Ledger evidence is **one line**, not a paragraph.
- After each commit, forget that task completely. It is recorded. Move on.

---

## THE STANDARD

Every commit must be one the owner can read in two minutes and keep or drop with total
confidence. Every report line must trace to output you actually saw. Every uncertainty
must be written down rather than papered over.

This product's entire premise is that it does not lie about its own performance. One
invented number makes every other number suspect.

**Work continuously. Record everything. Invent nothing. Push nothing.**
